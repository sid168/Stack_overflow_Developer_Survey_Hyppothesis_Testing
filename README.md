# Stack_overflow_Developer_Survey_Hyppothesis_Testing
Hypothesis Testing on Stackoverflow users

</br></br>
Each year, Stack Overflow surveys its users, who are primarily software developers, about themselves, how they use Stack Overflow, their work, and the development tools they use. We'll look at a subset of the survey responses from users who identified as Data Scientists.

### Scenario 1: 
### Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean annual compensation of data scientists is $110,000. Formally, 

H0:μ=110,000.

### Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The mean annual compensation of data scientists is not $110,000. Formally, 
HA:μ≠110,000


### Scenario 2: 

#### Claim: 35% Software developers started programming as children
Is this true?
Can we find the answer from this dataset?
Is there evidence that a greater proportion of Data Scientists started programming as children
### H0 (null_hypothesis) - Proportion of Data Scientists thta started programming as children =35%
H0 follows the claim
### HA (Alternate hypothesis) - Proportion of Data Scientists thta started programming as children >35%
HA challenges the claim



### Scenario 3: 

### H0 = The mean compensation is same regarldless whether they started coding as child or adult
### HA = The mean compensation for child coder > mean compensation for adult coder
